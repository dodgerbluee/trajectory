# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

- **Preferred:** In this repository, go to **Security** → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability** (private).
- **Alternative:** Email the maintainers (see repo description or README for contact). Encrypt if possible (e.g. GPG).

Include:

- Type of issue (e.g. auth bypass, IDOR, XSS) and affected component.
- Steps to reproduce and impact.
- Suggested fix or mitigation, if you have one (optional).

## Responsible disclosure

- We will acknowledge your report within **7 days** and aim to give an initial assessment within **14 days**.
- We will work with you on a fix and keep you updated. We aim to patch critical issues within **90 days** where feasible.
- We will credit you in the advisory/release notes (unless you prefer to stay anonymous).
- We ask that you **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released or we agree on a disclosure date. We suggest **90 days** from report as a reasonable window before public disclosure if no fix is available.

Thank you for helping keep Trajectory and its users safe.
