# Trajectory

Self-hosted, privacy-first app for tracking children's health data: growth, visits, illnesses, vaccines, and documents. For families and homelab users who want to keep this data on their own infrastructure.

**Who it's for:** Parents and caregivers who self-host. Data stays on your server; no cloud account required. You create the first user and manage access via families (one family per household today; multi-user sharing is in progress).
